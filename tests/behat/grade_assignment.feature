  In order to save time
  As a teacher
  I need to be able to grade assignments in Open Grader

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:

      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
      | student2 | Student | 2 | student2@example.com |
      | student3 | Student | 3 | student3@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | format |
      | Course 1 | C1 | topics |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | course | idnumber | name                   | intro | advancedgradingmethod_submissions |assignfeedback_comments_enabled |
      | assign   | C1     | A1       | Test assignment 1 name | TA1   | rubric                            |1							   |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |

      | student2 | C1 | student        |
      | student3 | C1 | student        |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I click on "Test assignment 1 name" "link"
    And I go to "Test assignment 1 name" advanced grading definition page
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Name | Assignment 1 rubric |
      | Description | Assignment 1 description |
    And I define the following rubric:
      | Criterion 1 | Level 11 | 11 | Level 12 | 12 |
      | Criterion 2 | Level 21 | 21 | Level 22 | 22 |
    And I press "Save rubric and make it ready"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Teacher grades a student's assignment
    Given I skip because "I will be reviewed on INT-20670"
    Given I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    Then I click on ".secondary-navigation li[data-region='openlmsmenu']" "css_element"
    And I follow "Open Grader"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I select "Student 1" from the "guser" singleselect
    And I click on "Grade with rubric" "button"
    And I grade by filling the Open Grader rubric with:
      | Criterion 1 | 12 | Very good |
      | Criterion 2 | 22 | Mmmm, you can do it better |
   	And "#id_assignfeedbackcomments_editoreditable" "css_element" should exist in the "#fitem_id_assignfeedbackcomments_editor" "css_element"
   	And ".atto_recordrtc_button_audio" "css_element" should exist in the ".atto_group.files_group" "css_element"
   	And ".atto_recordrtc_button_video" "css_element" should exist in the ".atto_group.files_group" "css_element"
    And I click on "Save grade" "button"
    Then I should see "Grade successfully updated"
